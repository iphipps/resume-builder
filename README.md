# Introduction

This repository should be a quick way to get a resume from JSON to PDF. That is, all styling and formatting should be done for you.

Why?  Because you should probably have an up-to-date resume, especially in the midst of a pandemic.
## Installation

```
npm install
npm start
```

Next, head to the browser at the correct port. To create the PDF, print the document and save as PDF.

### Gotchas

Spell check your resume.ts file.
